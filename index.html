            <h3 class="text-animation">I'm <span></span></h3>
            <p>Imagineer at <span>Fractal</span>, navigating the data seas while still in the baby steps of corporate life. 
               I may be figuring things out, but one thing‚Äôs for sure‚Äîif the work solves a real-world problem and 
               optimizes the solution in a smart, sustainable way, I‚Äôm all in. I‚Äôm not here just for the money, power, 
               or the fame grind; I want to build something that genuinely spreads peace, happiness, and good vibes all around. üåç‚ú®
            </p>
            <p>When I‚Äôm not diving into work, you can find me on the badminton court or taking a swim. Food? Total mood booster. 
                It‚Äôs not just about eating either; sometimes, it's about setting the scene: lights on, rock music blasting on Alexa, 
                and whipping up either my comfort food or some spontaneous creation sparked by cravings. While the moonlit nights
                are cool and all, I‚Äôm more of a morning person‚Äîbook in hand, soaking in the sunshine. Whether it‚Äôs hitting a karaoke
                bar or heading out on a hike, I‚Äôm usually game for a bit of adventure!
            </p>

                            Patna was my playground, and it shaped my early adventures and aspirations. </p>

                        <h3>High School</h3>
                        <p>My schooling kicked off at <span>Don Bosco Academy, Patna</span>, where I wrapped up my 10th with a solid <span>93.6%</span> in ICSE Boards. 
                            But it wasn‚Äôt just about hitting the books‚ÄîI was diving into everything! From smashing it on the badminton court, 
                            making waves in swimming, to proudly donning the NCC uniform for two years, I pretty much lived the high school dream.
                        </p>

                        <p> Next stop: <span>St. Michael's High School</span> for 12th, where I chose PCM with Economics as my battlefield. 
                            And while the academic pressure was no joke, I managed a respectable <span>75.2%</span> in CBSE (hey, we all have our moments!) and
                            snagged an <span>88.7</span> percentile in JEE Mains. To keep my adrenaline pumping, stayed active in swimming, 
                            and even had the incredible honor of competing at the National-level in 2018. 
                            So, yeah, it was a journey of balancing brains, brawn, and a whole lot of hustle!

                        <h3>College</h3>
                        <p>I kicked off my college life at <span>MIT World Peace University, Pune</span>, diving into a Bachelor's in <span>Electrical Engineering</span>. 
                            From day one, I was all in‚Äîjoining clubs, organizing events, and even keeping the energy alive during lockdown. 
                            That‚Äôs where I discovered my passion for marketing, sponsorships, and event management.
                        </p>

                        <p>By second year, I‚Äôd snagged the role of Design Head for the <span>Society of Women Engineers (SWE), MIT-WPU Affiliate</span>. 
                           I got recognized globally as a <span>SWE ambassador</span>, and to top it off, I bagged the <span>SWE Rising Star Award</span> the same year. 
                           During lockdown, I helped coordinate <span>Texephyr</span>, our tech-fest, pulling in sponsors and the second-highest number of participants among the organizing body.
                        </p>                
                        <p>Fast forward to 2022, I became the <span>President</span> of <span>MIT-WPU Shutterbugs</span>, a 70+ strong media club that handled everything from photography 
                            to social media for most of the college events. That same year, my friends and I launched <span>RIDE</span>, an event meant to connect founders, startups, 
                            and students with an entrepreneurial spark at one platform. I co-led <span>marketing and publicity</span>, growing our Instagram to 2k+ followers and LinkedIn to 100+.
                        </p>  
                        <p>On the sports front, I went from <span>volunteer</span> to <span>organizer</span> for <span>MIT-WPU Summit</span>, a national-level sports fest. 
                            We managed to bring in 300+ registrations from colleges across India, all while keeping the social media buzzing 
                            and making sure participants got the best on-ground experience.
                        </p>
                        <p>Well having kept myself engaged in all such activities, I didn't get left behind in academics. Yes, there were hurdles when my attendance was low
                            but I managed to graduate with a <span>9.5 CGPA</span> in Nov 2023.

                        <p>I was fortunate enough to land the <span>highest stipend internship</span> in my department at <span>Philips</span>, 
                            a six-month stint that was both financially rewarding and educational. 
                            While the main takeaway was a hefty paycheck that I channeled into building my stocks portfolio, 
                            I did gain some fascinating insights into the world of <span>MRIs</span>. From understanding the ins and outs of 
                            procuring replacement parts for outdated or damaged components to witnessing the behind-the-scenes 
                            process of maintaining cutting-edge medical equipment, the experience added valuable depth to my technical knowledge.

                        <p>From my on-campus placements, I snagged offers from both <span>Fractal Analytics</span> and <span>Reliance Industries</span>‚Äîtwo great

                        <p><span>Fractal</span>, a celebrated unicorn in the AI realm, welcomed me with open arms as an Imagineer. 
                            Over the past year, I‚Äôve dived headfirst into the world of <span>Azure</span> and <span>AWS</span>, soaking up knowledge like a sponge. 
                            I‚Äôve also tackled an exciting project for Merck in the pharmaceutical sector, where I delved into <span>GenAI Content Tagging (GAIT)</span>.
                        </p>
                        <p>But it‚Äôs not all been about the work. I‚Äôve rolled up my sleeves and jumped into the Imagineer Premier League, 
                            hosting a workshop for over 100 imagineers on the art of prompting. I‚Äôve also contributed to the CDT newsletter with articles on GenAI, 
                            keeping our community informed and engaged.
                            At <span>Fractal</span>, I‚Äôve learned, grown, and had a blast‚Äîhere‚Äôs to many more adventures ahead!

                    <h4>Movie Recommendation System</h4>
                    <p>A recommendation system is a subclass of information filtering system, that seeks to predict the "rating" or "preference" 
                        a user would give to an item. It filters the data using different algorithms and recommends the most relevant items to users. 
                        It first captures the past behavior of a customer and based on that, recommends products which the users might be likely to buy.
                        This project demonstrates a movie recommendation system built using Nearest Neighbor Algorithm.

                    <h4>Spam Mail Detection</h4>
                    <p>Every day, countless emails flood our inboxes, with spam sometimes overshadowing important messages. 
                        Spammers use sneaky tricks‚Äîlike flashy lottery wins or excessive BCC‚Äîto evade filters. 
                        While blocking senders or creating filters can help, Machine Learning offers a smarter solution. 
                        This project demonstrates a spam detection system powered by a Na√Øve Bayes classifier, designed to intelligently 
                        filter out spam and keep your inbox clean.
